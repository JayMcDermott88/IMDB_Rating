                    Attrition in business describes a gradual but deliberate 
                    reduction in staff numbers that occurs as employees retire 
                    or resign and are not replaced.This type of reduction in staff 
                    is called a hiring freeze.

                    It is one way a company can decrease labor costs without the 
                    disruption of layoffs. Reducing staff by attrition naturally 
                    is less devastating to company morale. However, it can still 
                    have a negative impact on the remaining employees if it leads 
                    to an increase in their workload. It also can limit promotional 
                    opportunities and movement within the company, resulting in 
                    an unhappier workplace or more attrition than was intended.

                <p>
                    For our project, we have have applied machine learning models 
                    to a dataset from IBM with the goal of using information on demographics, 
                    company position, income, and wellness reporting to determine whether 
                    or not an employee is likely to leave the company due to attrition.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    This is usefull for companies who are either trying to determine if a 
                    hiring freeze will be an effective cost saving measure in the long term. 
                    Alternatively, companies can use the prediction to better identify 
                    employees who ma leave that they otherwise might wish to retain 
                    in a hostile hiring environment. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    To that end, we have also supplied visualizations made in Tableau 
                    in order to better identify the employees most likely to fall to 
                    attrition. We have also used the FeatureSelect python library to 
                    determine the most important variables in predicting attrition.
