        <p>
            Attrition in business describes a gradual but deliberate 
            reduction in staff numbers that occurs as employees retire 
            or resign and are not replaced.This type of reduction in staff 
            is called a hiring freeze.

            It is one way a company can decrease labor costs without the 
            disruption of layoffs. Reducing staff by attrition naturally 
            is less devastating to company morale. However, it can still 
            have a negative impact on the remaining employees if it leads 
            to an increase in their workload. It also can limit promotional 
            opportunities and movement within the company, resulting in 
            an unhappier workplace or more attrition than was intended.
